##BRIEF OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

A Payroll Management System is a system that is used to manage all the employee’s financial records in a simple and automated fashion. Payroll management system manages employee’s salaries, deductions other conveyance, net pay, bonuses and generation of pay-slips etc.
Payroll Management System eases the hassles of managing vast amount of data by making the employee or faculty management and payroll processing easier. Payroll Management System makes it easier to calculate calculative heads like HRA, DA, TA, CLA, PT, PF etc. It also gives an overview about the income tax computation which helps the employees in tax planning. 

##NEED OF COMPUTERIZATION 

Instituting computerized payroll systems within business or organization can bring forth positive changes, saving hours producing and updating physical payroll journals and records. Computerized payroll systems come in the form of software packages that one must install on company computers. Whether a small, medium or large organization, this type of system creates efficiency as all records can be stored, organized and maintained electronically. Computerized payroll automates many functions, which saves both time and resources, decreasing the rate of errors whereas manual methods are time consuming and increase the chances of errors. 

##Advantages of payroll software

Many businesses choose to use payroll software over manual processing, as it can help them to:
• work out payroll calculations and deductions quicker
• generate accurate payslips
• calculate bonuses, expenses, holiday pay, etc. with minimum effort
• send returns to HMRC and print P45, P60 and other forms for employees
• automate certain tasks, such as year-end reporting
• reduce the burden of compliance
• remove the need to understand complex tax legislation
• store data such as payslips and annual reports in a secure, easily accessible system
• save time
• reduce the chances of error.

##Limitations of payroll software 

Payroll software, like any other IT system, can have certain weak points. Potential problems may arise around the issues such as:
 data security, loss or theft
 cyber security and fraud
 information access, quality and control

Other limitations with payroll software often arise around costs.
Full featured software will generally be more expensive than manual payroll systems.
It will also require computer equipment, resources and skilled operators. If we don't have these in-house, we will need to invest money into producing them.
